# quizz
This is a simple quizz system for use at Dreamhack Valencia in Colaboration with the Valencia Hackerspace

You are supposed to set the questions in the test.js file using json format, then run the system.

During the game:
n will show the next question (if marked as guessed or failed)
o will mark the question as guessed and grant points
r will cause a rebound and remove points
f will mark the question as failed and remove points
w will say player 1 knows the answer
a will say player 2 knows the answer
s will say player 3 knows the answer
d will say player 4 knows the answer
